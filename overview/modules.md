# ✨ Modules

Linecraft AI’s modular platform delivers targeted, AI-driven insights across every critical aspect of your production line. Each module is purpose-built to address specific operational challenges—from real-time machine monitoring and bottleneck analysis to asset criticality prioritization and comprehensive OEE tracking. Our solutions seamlessly integrate with your existing PLCs and enterprise systems, enabling incremental Industry 4.0 adoption without disruption.

## Dashboards

Linecraft AI dashboards provide a comprehensive, real-time view of your production line’s performance through intuitive, customizable templates. Monitor critical metrics such as OEE, JPH, uptime/downtime, bottlenecks, and quality indicators all in one place. With clear visualizations like trend graphs, heatmaps, and shift-level production data, dashboards enable you to quickly identify loss events, track progress against targets, and prioritize improvement actions.

## Bottlenecks

The Bottlenecks module in Linecraft AI identifies the cells or machines that throttle your production line flow by causing upstream and downstream waits. Leveraging advanced AI algorithms, it abstracts complex asset interactions and aggregates serial and parallel paths to automatically detect bottlenecks with high accuracy - eliminating guesswork and manual analysis.

## Critical cells

The Critical Cells module highlights the most important cells and assets on your manufacturing line that have the greatest influence on overall productivity and line efficiency. By evaluating Availability, Performance, and Quality - the three pillars of OEE - this module ranks cells based on their criticality, enabling you to focus maintenance, quality, and production efforts where they will deliver the highest impact.
