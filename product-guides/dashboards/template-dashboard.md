# Template Dashboard

Linecraft AI provides a wide range of pre-set templates that you can leverage to create your own template dashboard to monitor and analyze the following parameters:

* OEE
* JPH
* Good part production
* Overall production
* MTTR
* MTBF
* Downtimes and uptimes
* Bottlenecks
* Bad parts

#### OEE trend

The OEE trend graph highlights the OEE trend over a specified period of time along with the target OEE, in a line-chart view.

#### **JPH trend**

The JPH trend graph highlights the JPH trend over a specified period of time along with:

1. Average JPH
2. JPH availability, performance and quality losses

#### **On-shift good part production**

The on-shift good part production graph highlights the number of good parts produced during defined shift timings along with the production target

#### **Overall production**

The Overall production graph highlights the total number of parts (good and bad) produced during the defined shift timings and beyond that as well along with the target production

#### Downtime v/s uptime (cell and machine)

The downtime vs uptime graphs come in two variants: cell and machine.\
The cell downtime vs uptime graph highlights the duration when cells were down vs when they were up. The machine variant of it displays the same information, but for machines

#### JPH timeseries (cell and machine)

The JPH time series graphs come in two variants: cell and machine. The cell-wise JPH time series graph displays the following data for cells of a line, whereas the machine-wise JPH time series graph displays the same data, but for machines:

1. Average JPH
2. JPH availability loss
3. JPH performance loss
4. JPH quality loss

#### OEE time series (cell and machine)

The OEE time series graphs come in two variants: cell and machine. The cell-wise OEE time series graph displays the following data for cells of a line, whereas the machine-wise OEE time series graph displays the same data, but for machines:

1. OEE
2. Availability
3. Performance
4. Quality
5. Target OEE

#### MTBF time series

The MTBF time series represents the mean time taken between consecutive failures and the average MTBF, over a period of time

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (123).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### MTTR time series

The MTTR time series represents the mean time taken to repair failures and the average MTTR , over a period of time

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (124).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Bad parts pareto

The bad parts pareto represents a pareto chart of bad parts produced by a machine and how much each machine is contributing to the total number of bad parts produced

#### Bottleneck impact

The bottleneck impact represents the impact of bottleneck cells and machines on the entire line as a percentage value
