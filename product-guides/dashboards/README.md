# 📊 Dashboards

## Overview

The dashboard provides you with a first glance of the most important data points on your line. These can either be standard KPIs that all lines will track or specific data points that you would like to be able to see at a glance.

The top section of the dashboard consists of cards that depict your top 5 bottlenecks over the last 2 weeks. This feature is only available as part of the analyze and optimize plan.

If your line is on the monitor plan, you will not be able to see bottleneck cards.
{% endhint %}

Below this, you will see a list of sub-tabs with 4 options. These are the 4 different types of dashboards that you can view:
