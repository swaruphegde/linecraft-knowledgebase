# Analysis Dashboard

## Analysis dashboard

This subtab allows the user to add graphs for data points that are historic in nature. To create a graph, click on the create custom graph from the top right corner.

This will open a form where you will need to fill the following details:

1. Name of the graph
2. Parameter and Level Selection
3. Chart Parameter selection for Date range, Chart type, Resolution & Aggregator Selection
4. Entity/Machine selection for selecting the desired Machine/Cell/Process IO/ State

The analysis dashboard consists of a wide variety of parameters that you can select to plot a graph of your choice. You can also enter a custom formula of your own.

To create a custom formula, select custom formula from the parameter dropdown. This will then give you an option to either pick a pre created formula or create a new one. In the event that you have not yet created a custom formula, you will only see one option in the dropdown.

You can then use the custom formula creation screen to create the formula that you want. Simply choose the parameters that you would like to add and any mathematical operations required and click on Create.

Once a formula is created, it will show up in the list of custom formulas

Select variables and aggregators for your formula and you are good to go!

The selected parameters will be turned into a graph and will show up in the preview page

Here you have graph setting options like Graph Name, Selected Date Range, Filter Option, Resolution and Chart type.

The plotted graph is displayed in this section of the screen. The standard chart interactions like zooming on the selected area, moving forward and backwards in the range are available here. The plotted graph also has a target line plotted for it. Incase of a range target 2 lines i.e. min and max are plotted.

Once the graph is created and save, it will show up directly in your analysis dashboard. In the event that you would like to edit this graph, you can do so by clicking on the edit icon on the graph itself.
