# ðŸš¦ Bottleneck Opportunities

## Overview

Bottleneck Opportunities in Linecraft help you identify, analyze, and act on the most critical constraints affecting your production lineâ€™s performance. By surfacing the top bottlenecks, Linecraft enables you to focus your improvement efforts where they will have the greatest impact.

The dashboardâ€™s top section features cards that display your top 5 bottlenecks over the last 2 weeks. This feature is available as part of the Analyze and Optimize plans.

> **Note:** If your line is on the Monitor plan, bottleneck cards will not be visible.

## What is a Bottleneck?

A bottleneck is any process, machine, or cell that limits the overall throughput of your production line. Bottlenecks can cause delays, reduce efficiency, and impact your ability to meet production targets.

## How Bottleneck Opportunities Work

Linecraft continuously analyzes your line data to detect bottlenecks. The system identifies which machines or cells are most frequently limiting throughput and quantifies their impact.

### Bottleneck Cards

- **Top 5 Bottlenecks:** The dashboard displays cards for the five most significant bottlenecks from the past two weeks.
- **Impact Percentage:** Each card shows the percentage impact of the bottleneck on your lineâ€™s overall performance.
- **Trend Analysis:** Visual indicators help you see if a bottleneckâ€™s impact is increasing or decreasing over time.

## Bottleneck Impact Graph

The "Bottleneck Impact" graph visualizes the effect of bottleneck cells and machines on the entire line as a percentage value. This helps you quickly identify which areas require attention.

## How to Use Bottleneck Insights

1. **Review Bottleneck Cards:** Start by examining the top bottleneck cards on your dashboard.
2. **Analyze Impact:** Use the impact percentage and trend to prioritize which bottlenecks to address first.
3. **Drill Down:** Click on a bottleneck card to view detailed data, including downtime, frequency, and associated losses.
4. **Take Action:** Implement process improvements, maintenance, or operator training to address the root causes.
5. **Monitor Results:** Track changes in bottleneck impact over time to measure the effectiveness of your interventions.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Review:** Check bottleneck data at least weekly to stay ahead of emerging issues.
- **Collaborate:** Share bottleneck insights with your team to drive collective problem-solving.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Use bottleneck trends to guide your continuous improvement initiatives.
