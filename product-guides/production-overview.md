## Overview

The overview section of the production overview module provides a holistic view of shift-wise or day-wise production.  You can view the following information for a machine on the overview page of the production overview module. The end of line machine will be selected by default:&#x20;

1. Progress bar of current shift, its time and status&#x20;
2. KPIs
   1. Total parts produced&#x20;
   2. Total good parts produced&#x20;
   3. Total bad parts produced&#x20;
   4. OEE
   5. Availability
   6. Performance
   7. Quality
   8. Downtime
   9. MTTR
   10. MTBF
3. Production break-up by quality and part type&#x20;
4. JPH timeseries for that shift

This information can be viewed either shift-wise or day-wise.&#x20;

## Analysis

The analysis section of the production overview module enables you to view graphs and analyze parametric data for a machine over a custom date range. You can view and download graphs and data for the following parameters:

1. Production graphs&#x20;
   1. Overall production&#x20;
   2. JPH timeseries&#x20;
   3. OEE timeseries&#x20;
2. Part type graphs&#x20;
   1. Bad part types pareto&#x20;
3. Asset level graphs&#x20;
   1. Asset-wise overall production&#x20;
   2. Asset-wise JPH and JPH losses&#x20;
   3. Asset-wise OEE&#x20;
   4. Asset-wise bad parts pareto&#x20;

## Manage schedule

The manage schedule tab takes you to a new browser tab where you will be able to manage shifts and target count.  \
You will be able to:&#x20;

1. View shifts and their breaks for the selected date range&#x20;
2. Mark shifts as off&#x20;
3. Modify shifts and breaks for the selected date range
4. Reset changes to default values&#x20;
5. Modify targets for each part type in each shift for the selected date range&#x20;

## Shift and target modification

Shifts and JPH can also be modified for a duration of time, directly from the production schedules screen. To do this, simply click on the edit icon in the top left corner and select if you would like to modify your shifts or targets.

To modify shift timings, add or edit breaks and mark shifts as off, you can click on the modify shifts option in the dropdown

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Clicking on dates on the calendar allow you to edit the shifts for those days. Dates marked in red already have modifications made and can only be edited one at a time. Clicking on Reset resets all the modifications made for that month.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Hovering over the information icon will give you information about the configured shifts and timings. The shift group can be changed from the top drop down, however no new shift groups can be added from this feature.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The table below the shift groups will show you the current specified shift timings for the selected date or date range, In the event that you have selected a modified date, it will show modified shift timings.

To modify a particular shift, simply hover over it and click on the edit icon that appears over it. This will move the screen to the edit mode from where you can change the shift timings, add breaks or mark shifts as off. However you cannot add or delete a shift from this screen.

To modify the targets for your part types for a day or a date range, you can click on the modify targets button from the modification dropdown.

## Calendar

You will be redirected to a new browser tab when you click on the calendar section. This section will display a calendar view of the selected machine‚Äôs day-wise production information. You can hover over a date to view a detailed view of production metrics for that particular day.
