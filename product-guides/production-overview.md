# üóìÔ∏è Production overview

Production Overview allows you to ensure your line is meeting targets and helps monitor shift level production.&#x20;You can access production overview from the main menu by clicking on the production overview module.

## Overview

The overview section of the production overview module provides a holistic view of shift-wise or day-wise production.  You can view the following information for a machine on the overview page of the production overview module. The end of line machine will be selected by default:&#x20;

1. Progress bar of current shift, its time and status&#x20;
2. KPIs
   1. Total parts produced&#x20;
   2. Total good parts produced&#x20;
   3. Total bad parts produced&#x20;
   4. OEE
   5. Availability
   6. Performance
   7. Quality
   8. Downtime
   9. MTTR
   10. MTBF
3. Production break-up by quality and part type&#x20;
4. JPH timeseries for that shift

This information can be viewed either shift-wise or day-wise.&#x20;

## Analysis

The analysis section of the production overview module enables you to view graphs and analyze parametric data for a machine over a custom date range. You can view and download graphs and data for the following parameters:

1. Production graphs&#x20;
   1. Overall production&#x20;
   2. JPH timeseries&#x20;
   3. OEE timeseries&#x20;
2. Part type graphs&#x20;
   1. Bad part types pareto&#x20;
3. Asset level graphs&#x20;
   1. Asset-wise overall production&#x20;
   2. Asset-wise JPH and JPH losses&#x20;
   3. Asset-wise OEE&#x20;
   4. Asset-wise bad parts pareto&#x20;

## Manage schedule

The manage schedule tab takes you to a new browser tab where you will be able to manage shifts and target count.  \
You will be able to:&#x20;

1. View shifts and their breaks for the selected date range&#x20;
2. Mark shifts as off&#x20;
3. Modify shifts and breaks for the selected date range
