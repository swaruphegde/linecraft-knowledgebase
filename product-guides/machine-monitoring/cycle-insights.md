# Cycle insights

We've introduced **Cycle Insights**, a powerful machine learning driven feature that automatically analyses production cycles to uncover key patterns and detect anomalies. With this new capability, users can:

1. **Understand typical machine behavior** over selected time ranges
2. **Identify deviations** and problematic states in production cycles
3. **Gain actionable insights** to improve efficiency and support better operational decisions

This enhancement empowers teams to move from reactive monitoring to proactive optimization through data-driven analysis.
